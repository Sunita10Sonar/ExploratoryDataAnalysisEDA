# ðŸŒ¸ Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Iris dataset**, a fundamental dataset used in data science and machine learning. It provides insights into the distribution, relationships, and trends among various features of three iris flower species.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of petal and sepal features
- Explore feature relationships using pair plots and correlation heatmaps
- Use visualizations to distinguish between the three flower species
- Prepare the dataset for potential machine learning tasks

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations

- **Histograms** for distribution analysis  
- **Boxplots** to detect outliers  
- **Pairplot** to observe inter-feature relationships  
- **Heatmap** to understand feature correlations
